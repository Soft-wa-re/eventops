# Group Chat & Online Communication Guidelines

*(Addendum to the Code of Conduct)*

**Last Updated:** {{ site.last_updated }}

These Group Chat & Online Communication Guidelines apply only to digital communication spaces administered by **{{ page.organizer_legal }}**, doing business as **{{ page.group_name }}** (the “Community Chat”).

These guidelines operate in conjunction with the Code of Conduct and apply solely to messaging platforms and online communication channels managed by the Organizer.

## 1. Purpose of the Community Chat

The Community Chat exists primarily for:

* Event coordination and announcements
* Light, community-oriented interaction
* Sharing information relevant to upcoming Events

The Community Chat is not intended to function as a general debate forum or open-topic discussion board.

---

## 2. Political and Divisive Topics

To maintain a welcoming and low-conflict environment for participants of diverse backgrounds and viewpoints:

* Partisan political campaigning, advocacy, or debate is not permitted within the Community Chat.
* Content likely to generate divisive or hostile discussion may be removed.
* Repeated attempts to initiate polarizing discussions may result in moderation action within the Community Chat.

This guideline applies regardless of political affiliation or viewpoint.

---

## 3. Off-Topic Posting

Occasional light conversation is welcome. However:

* Repeated off-topic posting that disrupts the primary purpose of the Community Chat may be moderated.
* Spam, promotional content, or unrelated advertising is not permitted without prior approval.

---

## 4. Excessive Posting

To keep the Community Chat usable for everyone:

* Avoid sending many back-to-back messages in a short time, especially if the content could be combined into one message.
* Avoid “flooding” the chat with multiple photos, videos, or long multi-part updates. When possible, consolidate or use a single post/thread.
* If you have a longer discussion, move it to direct messages (DMs) unless it’s clearly relevant to the broader group.
* Repeated excessive posting after a moderator request to slow down may result in moderation action.

---

## 5. Moderation Authority (Chat Only)

The Organizer reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to moderate the Community Chat, including:

* Removing or editing messages
* Temporarily muting participants
* Removing individuals from the Community Chat
* Restricting posting privileges within the Community Chat

Moderation decisions apply only to the Community Chat and do not affect a resident’s status with the property or access to the apartment complex.

Moderation decisions are made to preserve a respectful, welcoming environment and are final.

---

## 6. Escalation

Participants who repeatedly violate these guidelines may:

* Receive a warning
* Be temporarily suspended from the Community Chat
* Be removed from the Community Chat

In serious cases, behavior may be referred to appropriate authorities or property management if required by law or safety concerns.

---

## 7. Relationship to Code of Conduct

All expectations outlined in the Code of Conduct apply within the Community Chat.

Participation in the Community Chat constitutes agreement to abide by these guidelines.
