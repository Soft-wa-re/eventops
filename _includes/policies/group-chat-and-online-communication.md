## 1. Purpose of Community Spaces

Community Spaces exist primarily for:

* Sharing information relevant to upcoming Events

These spaces are not intended to serve as general debate forums or open-topic discussion boards.

## 2. Political and Divisive Topics

To maintain a welcoming and low-conflict environment for participants of diverse backgrounds and viewpoints:

* Partisan political campaigning, advocacy, or debate is not permitted.
* Content likely to generate divisive or hostile discussion may be removed.
* Repeated attempts to initiate polarizing discussions may result in moderation.

This guideline applies regardless of political affiliation or viewpoint.

## 3. Off-Topic Posting

Occasional light conversation is welcome. However:

* Repeated off-topic posting that disrupts the primary purpose of the space may be moderated.
* Spam, promotional content, or unrelated advertising is not permitted without prior approval.

The Organizer reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to:

* Remove or edit messages

* Restrict posting privileges

Moderation decisions are made to preserve a respectful, welcoming environment and are final.
