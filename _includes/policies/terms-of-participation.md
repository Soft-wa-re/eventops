The Organizer reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to:

for behavior that is unsafe, disruptive, harassing, unlawful, or inconsistent with these Terms or the community’s values.

No refunds are required in cases of removal for misconduct.

## 6. Alcohol and Substances

Some Events may take place at venues where alcohol is available. The Organizer does **not** provide alcohol unless explicitly stated and is not responsible for monitoring consumption.

You are solely responsible for:

## 7. Event Changes and Cancellations

Event details, including time, location, format, or venue, may change. Events may be canceled or modified for reasons including low attendance, weather, venue issues, or other circumstances.

By remaining RSVPed to or attending an Event, Participants accept the Event based on conditions reasonably known at the time, including weather, venue conditions, and general attendance level.

## 8. Photography and Media

Some Events may be photographed, recorded, or live-streamed for community, promotional, or informational purposes.

By participating in an Event, you grant the Organizer permission to use photos, video, or audio recordings taken at Events.

If you prefer not to be photographed or recorded, please let the Organizer or event host know in advance and position yourself outside areas where photography or recording is taking place. We’ll make reasonable efforts to accommodate requests, but photography and recording may occur in group or public settings where individual exclusion isn’t always practical.

By remaining in areas where photography or recording is happening, you acknowledge and accept that you may be included in photos or recordings. We’re not able to remove or edit media after it has been captured or shared.

## 9. No Professional Advice

Events are social and community-oriented in nature. Nothing shared at an Event constitutes professional, legal, medical, or financial advice.

---

## 10. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **State of South Carolina**, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
