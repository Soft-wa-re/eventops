# Refund and Cancellation Policy

**Last Updated:** {{ site.last_updated }}

This Refund and Cancellation Policy applies to all events, activities, meetups, and related offerings (“Events”) organized, hosted, promoted, or facilitated by **{{ page.organizer_legal }}**, doing business as **{{ page.group_name }}**, and its affiliated brands, projects, or community groups (the “Organizer”).

By registering for, RSVPing to, attending, or participating in any Event, you (“Participant,” “you,” or “your”) acknowledge and agree to the following:

---

## 1. Event Types

Events generally fall into one of the following categories:

### Free Events

No payment is required. No refunds apply.

### Paid Events – Cash Payment

Payment is collected in cash at or near the time of the Event. Once collected, payments are non-refundable unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Paid Events – Delayed or Conditional Payment

For some Events, payment information may be collected or authorized in advance, but **payment is only completed shortly before the Event occurs**, typically after minimum attendance and event viability are confirmed.

If an Event is canceled or converted to a free Event **before payment is completed**, no charge will occur.

---

## 2. General Refund Policy

Because payment for paid Events is typically completed **at or shortly before the Event**, refunds are **not expected and are not the default**.

Refunds may be issued **only** in limited circumstances, including:

- Event cancellation **after** payment has been completed  
- Duplicate or erroneous payments attributable to the Organizer  
- Other reasonable circumstances as determined by the Organizer, at its discretion

No other circumstances entitle a Participant to a refund.

---

## 3. Participant Cancellations, Weather, and No-Shows

Unless explicitly stated otherwise for a specific Event:

- No refunds are issued for participant cancellations  
- No refunds are issued for no-shows  
- No refunds are issued for late arrivals or early departures  

Weather conditions, environmental factors, or participant discomfort do **not** constitute grounds for a refund if the Event proceeds as scheduled.

By remaining RSVPed to or attending an Event, Participants accept the Event as it is reasonably known at that time, including weather conditions, attendance level, and other visible or foreseeable circumstances.

---

## 4. Organizer Cancellations

If the Organizer cancels an Event:

- If payment has **not** yet been completed, no charge will occur  
- If payment **has** been completed, the Organizer may, at its discretion:
  - Issue a refund of the ticket price **excluding non-refundable processing fees**, or  
  - Provide a credit toward a future Event

The Organizer is not responsible for travel, lodging, parking, meals, or other incidental expenses.

---

## 5. Minimum Attendance and Event Viability

Some Events require a minimum level of participation to be viable as a paid Event.

If attendance is materially lower than expected, the Organizer may determine that the Event is **not viable as a paid Event**, even if RSVPs, weather, and venue conditions were otherwise acceptable based on advance information.

In such cases, the Organizer may, at its discretion:

- Choose not to complete or collect payment and proceed with the gathering as a free Event  
- Reschedule the Event  
- Issue refunds (in whole or in part) to Participants who attended and paid  

No refunds are issued to Participants who did not attend or failed to appear without notice.

---

## 6. Payment Processing Fees

Third-party payment processors may charge **non-refundable processing or transaction fees**.

If a refund is issued:

- The ticket price may be refunded  
- Processing or transaction fees are **not refundable**, unless explicitly stated otherwise

---

## 7. Removals for Conduct Violations

Participants removed from an Event due to violations of the Code of Conduct, Terms of Participation, or applicable laws are **not eligible for refunds or credits**.

---

## 8. Chargebacks and Payment Disputes

Initiating a chargeback or payment dispute without first contacting the Organizer may result in removal from current and future Events.

Chargebacks inconsistent with this policy may be treated as violations of the Terms of Participation, and the Organizer reserves the right to contest such disputes.

---

## 9. Policy Changes

The version of this Refund and Cancellation Policy in effect at the time of RSVP or payment applies to that Event.
